<p>Dear members of the PORTO HYDRA Timeshare Owners Association, the chairman and the board welcome you to our website. We put the effort of making this website in order to have a more frequent and direct contact with our members, especially now that the problems we face from the current ownership of the hotel complex (and the discontinuation of its operation), brought in our memory the problems we faced the past years from the -perhaps intended against the timeshare owners- mismanagement of the previous ownership.</p>
<p>Our posts and news articles will help you keep in touch with our activities, and monitor all the current issues we pursue. Please do not hesitate to send us your thoughts and opinions, but also your questions and any problems that you may have concerning your time shares. Use the menu above to learn more about the Association, see our latest news and find out about the available ways of contacting us.</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN AND THE BOARD</p>
